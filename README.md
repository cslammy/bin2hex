# bin2hex

Some techs are good at seeing hex and converting it to binary in their noggin, but I'm not.  So I wrote or stole a couple of functions to convert hex/decimal to binary. 

bin2hex uses recursion and printf as a side effect. Only 4 lines of code, so, easy! 

However, I also wanted a function to return the binary as a pointer to a string. bin2hex4 functions does that.

Code was written on CodeBlocks using a windows 10 PC, but should be portable to embedded systems by modifying the malloc statement.
